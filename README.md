- 👋 Hi, I’m @RicardoSimao  and I'm not a programer.... so if you find issues with the codes I am available to help and to learn with you. If you find my code interesting feel free to take it, but whatever youdo, make it public so we may forma a comunity :D  
- 👀 I’m interested in non-linear dynamics applied on biological and sociological systems. Actwally, I'm interested in EVERYTHING but I only human
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to aplicate non-linear dynamics ideas and concepts in systems which environment changes with time due to actions of the components of same system. Such as learning and addictions, chosing public representants, life formation and development and financial market. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on EVERYTHING. As I'm only human, I think the most important thing that I cannot attack alone is put evolutinary game dyamics tools in more firm mathematical grounds on physical aplications and use it to predict breaking points, changes of collective behaviors and constraints on the systems that force them to behave the way one wants.   
- 📫 You can reach me through the email on this repository, or (more likelly) by the email ojogodascontasdevidro@gmail.com.
